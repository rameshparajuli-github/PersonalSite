      <p class="lead">Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light,
        either electronically by means of an image sensor,
        or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.
        It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography),
        and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational
        purposes, hobby, and mass communication.Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected
        or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a
        timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel,
        which is electronically processed and stored
        in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing.</p>

      </h2>
      <p class="lead">A computer program is a series of instructions, written in words,
        numbers and symbols. Just like any spoken sentence is in a human language like English or French,
        every computer program is in a programming language. A few popular programming languages are
        Python (what we will teach here), C++, JavaScript and PHP. We have chosen to teach Python since
        it is both simple enough for beginners and powerful enough to be used by modern companies.
        All programming languages use the same general principles,
        so after you know any one language, you can learn others more quickly.Thousands of different programming
        languages have been created,
        and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form
        (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form
        (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Graphic Design: <span class="text-muted">Checkmate.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Graphic design is a notion for defining a visual communication tool.
        In other words, this is a sort of craft which helps individuals create content of
        different quality and complexity levels by
        using multiple page layout and perspective hierarchy techniques.

        Such an approach involves applying raster or even vector images,
        as well as typography means to satisfy consumers’ objectives and requirements.
        At the same time, the focus is still on the logical and harmonic displaying of the
        project’s elements in order to boost end users’ experience.Graphic Designer in Daily Life Being a graphic
        designer not all that easy One thing that graphic designer have to do is meet a strict deadlines.You will
        find yourself working odd hours but this schedule isn’t all that bad. Many people don’t realize the logo on on
        the thing they have is made by graphic designer and it may could 've taking a long time.The stress and worry
        and
        criticism are all things you learn to deal with as time goes by normally criticism is
        the first thing as you know who to listen</p>
